- **Rate movies** from 1 to 5 stars
- **Add new movies** with genre support
- **Update or delete** existing movies

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually bundled with Python)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-gui.git
cd movie-recommendation-gui
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the App

```bash
python movie_gui_app.py
```

## How It Works

The application uses a simple hash map (dictionary) to store movie titles and ratings. Recommendations are generated by comparing your rated movies to other entries and suggesting similar genres or highly-rated movies.

## Project Structure

```bash
📁 movie-recommendation-gui/
├── movie_gui_app.py             # Main Tkinter GUI code
├── README.md                    # GitHub documentation
├── requirements.txt             # List of dependencies (if any)
└── data/
    └── movies.json              # Optional: save/load persistent movie data

Security & Persistence

This version runs locally and does not require any online access. You may optionally enhance it by:
- Saving movie data using JSON or SQLite.
- Adding login/authentication for user-specific recommendations.

Future Improvements

- Integrate with TMDb or IMDb API for real-time data.
- Improve recommendation logic using collaborative filtering.
- Enhance the GUI with Tkinter themes or ttkbootstrap.
- Add cloud-based storage or user authentication (optional).
